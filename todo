Separate out the enums from enums.h
DoganBuilding is currently relying on the `getComplementDirections` function returning North and South first where relevant. Figure out a way to not rely on this.
Add ports
Add cards
Add players
Add boundary checking for config class
Change uses of push_back to emplace_back where applicable
Change all declarations of type* var to type *var
Change all declarations of type& var to type &var
Add const to all getter functions like func(...) const {}
add use of std::optional where applicable
Replace all instances of Cell & Board with DoganCell & DoganBoard (where applicable)
Possibly overwrite Cell to DoganCell in DoganBoard
